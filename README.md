### Project Description
The Medicine Reminder system is a web-based application that helps users schedule and manage their medication timings efficiently. It allows users to select dates from an interactive calendar, set reminder times, and receive notifications at the exact allotted time. The system ensures users never miss their medicines through timely alerts and a user-friendly interface.

### The Problem statement
Many people forget to take their medicines on time, leading to health complications and poor treatment outcomes. There is a need for a simple and reliable system that provides timely reminders to ensure proper medication adherence.

### The Solution
Develop a user-friendly web-based medicine reminder system that allows users to select dates and set specific times for medication, providing timely notifications to ensure medicines are taken as prescribed.
